# Vector Space Weather Report Art Gallery

This project is a small web gallery that displays artwork generated with ChatGPT. Clicking any image opens a panel with additional details including title, description, generation date, prompts, and a short weather report.

## Running the Gallery

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Navigation links at the top of each page lead to the home Gallery, an About page, and a Project Prompts page.
